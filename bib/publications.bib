  title = {Selecting the Independent Coordinates of Manifolds with Large Aspect Ratios},
  copyright = {All rights reserved},
  abstract = {Many manifold embedding algorithms fail apparently when the data manifold has a large aspect ratio (such as a long, thin strip). Here, we formulate success and failure in terms of finding a smooth embedding, showing also that the problem is pervasive and more complex than previously recognized. Mathematically, success is possible under very broad conditions, provided that embedding is done by carefully selected eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator \$\textbackslash{}Delta\$. Hence, we propose a bicriterial Independent Eigencoordinate Selection (IES) algorithm that selects smooth embeddings with few eigenvectors. The algorithm is grounded in theory, has low computational overhead, and is successful on synthetic and large real data.},

  abstract = {Dynamic extensions of Stochastic block model (SBM) are of importance in several fields that generate temporal interaction data. These models, besides producing compact and interpretable network representations, can be useful in applications such as link prediction or network forecasting. In this paper we present a conditional pseudo-likelihood based extension to dynamic SBM that can be efficiently estimated by optimizing a regularized objective. Our formulation leads to a highly scalable approach that can handle very large networks, even with millions of nodes. We also extend our formalism to causal impact for networks that allows us to quantify the impact of external events on a time dependent sequence of networks. We support our work with extensive results on both synthetic and real networks.},

  abstract = {Random laser actions in ultraviolet and visible regions have been demonstrated based on the composites consisting of bio-inspired diatom frustules. Owing to the low optical loss derived from porous network of diatom structures, we report wide spectrum range random lasers arising from GaN film and Rh6G dye via using biological diatoms as scattering centers. Interestingly, both ultraviolet and visible-range random laser actions with very sharp peaks can be easily obtained, with the average length of optics cavity closed to the average size of diatom frustules in both cases, indicating the excellent optical confinement of diatom frustules. It is expected that the first proof of concept shown here can pave an avenue toward future broad-range random lasers and eco-friendly biophotonics devices with high performance and wide spectrum response.},

  title = {Biologically Inspired Band-Edge Laser Action from Semiconductor with Dipole-Forbidden Band-Gap Transition},
  volume = {5},
  copyright = {2015 Nature Publishing Group},
  issn = {2045-2322},
  abstract = {A new approach is proposed to light up band-edge stimulated emission arising from a semiconductor with dipole-forbidden band-gap transition. To illustrate our working principle, here we demonstrate the feasibility on the composite of SnO2 nanowires (NWs) and chicken albumen. SnO2 NWs, which merely emit visible defect emission, are observed to generate a strong ultraviolet fluorescence centered at 387 nm assisted by chicken albumen at room temperature. In addition, a stunning laser action is further discovered in the albumen/SnO2 NWs composite system. The underlying mechanism is interpreted in terms of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the chicken albumen protein to SnO2 NWs. More importantly, the giant oscillator strength of shallow defect states, which is served orders of magnitude larger than that of the free exciton, plays a decisive role. Our approach therefore shows that bio-materials exhibit a great potential in applications for novel light emitters, which may open up a new avenue for the development of bio-inspired optoelectronic devices.},
