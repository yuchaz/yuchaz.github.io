  abstract = {Dynamic extensions of Stochastic block model (SBM) are of importance in several fields that generate temporal interaction data. These models, besides producing compact and interpretable network representations, can be useful in applications such as link prediction or network forecasting. In this paper we present a conditional pseudo-likelihood based extension to dynamic SBM that can be efficiently estimated by optimizing a regularized objective. Our formulation leads to a highly scalable approach that can handle very large networks, even with millions of nodes. We also extend our formalism to causal impact for networks that allows us to quantify the impact of external events on a time dependent sequence of networks. We support our work with extensive results on both synthetic and real networks.},

  abstract = {The null space of the \$k\$-th order Laplacian \$\textbackslash mathbf\{\textbackslash mathcal L\}\_k\$, known as the \{\textbackslash em \$k\$-th homology vector space\}, encodes the non-trivial topology of a manifold or a network. Understanding the structure of the homology embedding can thus disclose geometric or topological information from the data. The study of the null space embedding of the graph Laplacian \$\textbackslash mathbf\{\textbackslash mathcal L\}\_0\$ has spurred new research and applications, such as spectral clustering algorithms with theoretical guarantees and estimators of the Stochastic Block Model. In this work, we investigate the geometry of the \$k\$-th homology embedding and focus on cases reminiscent of spectral clustering. Namely, we analyze the \{\textbackslash em connected sum\} of manifolds as a perturbation to the direct sum of their homology embeddings. We propose an algorithm to factorize the homology embedding into subspaces corresponding to a manifold's simplest topological components. The proposed framework is applied to the \{\textbackslash em shortest homologous loop detection\} problem, a problem known to be NP-hard in general. Our spectral loop detection algorithm scales better than existing methods and is effective on diverse data such as point clouds and images.},

  abstract = {Manifold learning (ML), a form of non-linear dimension reduction, maps data to spaces with fewer coordinates, while preserving its large scale properties. ML is being used by scientists for analysis and discovery in large, high dimensional data obtained by simulation and observation. Despite many empirical successes of the ML algorithms, the statistics know-how associated with these algorithms has not yet been adopted in the mainstream use. In this paper, we present a complete framework for performing ML on scientific data, with in-depth discussions of the modeling choices, as well as the post-processing choices that influence the quality of the results. This includes selection of bandwidth parameter, choices of kernel function and graph Laplacian for preprocessing, and postprocessing methods to refine and correct distortions in the obtained embedding. The framework is exemplified with embeddings of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Using this framework, scientists will be better able to avoid algorithmic artefacts and to obtain more reproducible and interpretable results.},

  abstract = {The manifold Helmholtzian (1-Laplacian) operator \${$\Delta\_$}1\$ elegantly generalizes the Laplace-Beltrami operator to vector fields on a manifold \$\textbackslash mathcal M\$. In this work, we propose the estimation of the manifold Helmholtzian from point cloud data by a weighted 1-Laplacian \$\textbackslash mathbf\{\textbackslash mathcal L\}\_1\$. While higher order Laplacians ave been introduced and studied, this work is the first to present a graph Helmholtzian constructed from a simplicial complex as an estimator for the continuous operator in a non-parametric setting. Equipped with the geometric and topological information about \$\textbackslash mathcal M\$, the Helmholtzian is a useful tool for the analysis of flows and vector fields on \$\textbackslash mathcal M\$ via the Helmholtz-Hodge theorem. In addition, the \$\textbackslash mathbf\{\textbackslash mathcal L\}\_1\$ allows the smoothing, prediction, and feature extraction of the flows. We demonstrate these possibilities on substantial sets of synthetic and real point cloud datasets with non-trivial topological structures; and provide theoretical results on the limit of \$\textbackslash mathbf\{\textbackslash mathcal L\}\_1\$ to \${$\Delta\_$}1\$.},

Owing to the low optical loss derived from porous network of diatom structures, we report wide spectrum range random lasers arising from GaN film and Rh6G dye via using biological diatoms as scattering centers. Interestingly, both ultraviolet and visible-range random laser actions with very sharp peaks can be easily obtained, with the average length of optics cavity closed to the average size of diatom frustules in both cases, indicating the excellent optical confinement of diatom frustules. It is expected that the first proof of concept shown here can pave an avenue toward future broad-range random lasers and eco-friendly biophotonics devices with high performance and wide spectrum response.},

  abstract = {Many social mammals form discrete social communities within larger populations. For nonterritorial, polygynous, size-dimorphic species, sex- and age-class differences in life-history requirements might mediate differences in social connectedness and transitions among communities. We conducted social network analysis and community detection with an extensive data set of 1081 individually identified wild giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, over 5 years to test predictions that adult males and young of both sexes show greater social connectedness (degree, closeness and betweenness centrality) and transition more often among social communities than adult females, which form stronger and more stable relationships. We also expected that young animals would be more socially connected than adults. Using both static and dynamic network clustering techniques, we detected four distinct mixed-sex social communities, which we termed `super-communities' to differentiate this apex level of social organization from intermediate-level female-only communities. Most ({$\sim$}70\%) giraffes remained within their same super-community, and those (usually adult males) that visited a different super-community often returned to their original super-community. Males \textendash{} both adults and calves \textendash{} had higher social centrality scores than females, and adult males were closer to all other individuals in the network and transitioned among super-communities twice as often as females and calves, reflecting their roaming reproductive strategy of seeking females in oestrus. Of all age and sex classes, young males had the most social ties and highest betweenness (moved most often among groups), which we attributed to social exploration prior to natal dispersal. Overall, female giraffes have stronger social associations than males, but males exceed females in measures of social connectedness, reflecting differences in reproductive and life-history profiles. Our findings suggest that giraffe translocations that do not consider sociality are likely to break up established social associations and potentially reduce fitness.},

  abstract = {A new approach is proposed to light up band-edge stimulated emission arising from a semiconductor with dipole-forbidden band-gap transition. To illustrate our working principle, here we demonstrate the feasibility on the composite of SnO2 nanowires (NWs) and chicken albumen. SnO2 NWs, which merely emit visible defect emission, are observed to generate a strong ultraviolet fluorescence centered at 387 nm assisted by chicken albumen at room temperature. In addition, a stunning laser action is further discovered in the albumen/SnO2 NWs composite system. The underlying mechanism is interpreted in terms of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the chicken albumen protein to SnO2 NWs. More importantly, the giant oscillator strength of shallow defect states, which is served orders of magnitude larger than that of the free exciton, plays a decisive role. Our approach therefore shows that bio-materials exhibit a great potential in applications for novel light emitters, which may open up a new avenue for the development of bio-inspired optoelectronic devices.},
