Abstract
========

Random laser actions in ultraviolet and visible regions have been demonstrated based on the composites consisting of bio-inspired diatom frustules. Owing to the low optical loss derived from porous network of diatom structures, we report wide spectrum range random lasers arising from GaN film and Rh6G dye via using biological diatoms as scattering centers. Interestingly, both ultraviolet and visible-range random laser actions with very sharp peaks can be easily obtained, with the average length of optics cavity closed to the average size of diatom frustules in both cases, indicating the excellent optical confinement of diatom frustules. It is expected that the first proof of concept shown here can pave an avenue toward future broad-range random lasers and eco-friendly biophotonics devices with high performance and wide spectrum response.
