abstract: 'In all manifold learning algorithms and tasks setting the kernel bandwidth $\varepsilon$ used construct the graph Laplacian is critical. We address this problem by choosing a quality criterion for the Laplacian, that measures its ability to preserve the geometry of the data. For this, we exploit the connection between manifold geometry, represented by the Riemannian metric, and the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Experiments show that this principled approach is effective and robust.'
