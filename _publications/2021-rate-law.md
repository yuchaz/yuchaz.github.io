abstract: 'Optical absorbance is used to study the kinetics of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) thin film degradation in response to combinations of moisture, oxygen, and illumination over a range of temperatures. 105 degradations were conducted over 41 unique environmental conditions. We discover that water acts synergistically with oxygen in a water-accelerated photo-oxidation (WPO) pathway. This pathway is the dominant pathway at 25 $^\circ$C and is 10, 100, 1000, and >1000 times faster than dry photooxidation (DPO), degradation via hydrate formation, thermal degradation, and blue light degradation, respectively. We find that the rate determining step for DPO is proton abstraction from methylammonium while for WPO it is proton abstraction from water, which occurs at a faster rate and results in water acting as an accelerant for photooxidation of MAPbI3. A full kinetic rate equation is derived and fitted to the data to determine activation energies and rate constants.'
