abstract: 'One of the aims of both linear and non-linear dimension reduction is to find a reduced set of *collective variables* that describe the data manifold. While algorithms return abstract coordinates such as spaces spanned by eigenvectors of data-dependent matrices, one can often associate these with features of the data, and hence with domain-related meaning. Usually, finding these domain-related or physical meanings is done via visual inspection by an expert. Our work formulates this problem as *sparse, non-parametric, non-linear* recovery of the manifold coordinates over a user-defined dictionary of domain-related functions. We show that the original problem can be transformed into a *linear Group Lasso* problem, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on molecular simulation data.'
