Covers discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals; sampling rate conversion; frequency magnitude, phase delay, and group delay; design techniques for non-recursive (FIR) filters; multirate signal processing; all-pass/minimum phase decompositions; discrete Fourier transforms, fast Fourier transforms; overlap-add; short-time Fourier analysis; and filter banks. Includes applications such as machine learning.
